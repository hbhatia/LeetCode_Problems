I have done it with Simple HashMap technique,also mentioned in Solution.
​
Heap approach is not done so it is also needed to be done.
​
*Trie Approach of store every word in it and store count of each word with isLeafNode field won't work here because question is different*. That approach we can apply if we are asked to return count or freqency of a word in a dictionary.
​
**So try to udnerstand the difference between both question.
Here hashmap<String,Integer> would work not the Hashmap<Integer,ArrayList<String>>
**
